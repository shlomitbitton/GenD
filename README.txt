Write a small program in Java that reads in the two provided tab delimited files and
1. Sorts the two lists into one list in alphabetical order by last name
2. Counts the number of duplicate first names
3. Gives the average age of both lists combined
Output the results to screen and to a csv file in the following format:

Lastname, firstname, age
.
.
.
There were x incidences of duplicate first names
The average age for both files was x

Please return the code, the csv file, and a screen shot of the output, and any other supporting information to run it. Note any assumptions made.
Indicate what version of Java was used, and what IDE.
Please do not send back a zip file, our firewall blocks all zip files.

-----------------------------------
My assumptions:

1. The input files have the same structure of: 
lastName firstName age

2. Sort request of alphabetical order is in ascending order.

3. The average age calculation doesnt care about duplicate names.
